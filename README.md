Amid Wars, Political tussles war, the influence of Nonstate Actors, etc., Refugees are the one who suffers the most. They need help with proper Healthcare and consultations with Doctors due to the lack of Doctors on the ground. Our Doctors online (Video chat Integrated within Rehmat for scaling) will ease the workload of doctors on the ground so that they can focus on severe cases on priorities. Our On-Site team, consisting of volunteers, would also be available during disasters in Refugee Camps. These teams would be beneficial when refugees don't have access to the Internet/devices. Rehmat accomplishes three SDG goals: SDG Goal 3 (Good Health and Well Being), SDG Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).
